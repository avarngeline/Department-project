# Department-project
This project analyses Late Export Declarations in the Marketing Department, which may impact BOI stock adjustments and Thai Customs compliance. Using Fishbone Analysis, 5W1H, and BPMN 2.0, we optimized workflows, assigned responsibilities, and automated processes, achieving a 100% reduction from 149 cases to 0 in Q1 2020.
